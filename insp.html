                    <p style="margin-bottom: 50px">Several studies have highlighted the racial disparities in traffic fatalities, showing that minorities, particularly Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), are disproportionately affected.

                        A report from the Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA) found that traffic fatalities between 2015 and 2019 disproportionately impacted BIPOC communities. This report emphasizes the importance of equitable traffic enforcement and community outreach to reduce these disparities. It highlights systemic issues in transportation that contribute to the higher risk of crashes among these groups, advocating for tailored safety measures in vulnerable communities​(

                    <p>Several factors contribute to this disparity. Communities of color often intersect with dangerous road infrastructure, experience slower emergency response times, and may lack access to quality follow-up care. This "safety inequity" is compounded by historical underinvestment in infrastructure in these communities. Experts argue that addressing this requires not only better traffic enforcement but also significant infrastructure investments to improve safety​(
